    -   **Without Hakoniwa**: Allows the drone's physical and control models to be executed independently. Integration with PX4/Ardupilot is also possible.


> 🧩 **What is Hakoniwa?**
> It is a **simulation hub that realizes distributed cooperative operation** by connecting multiple simulators and control nodes under a common time and communication infrastructure.
> It features an open architecture that connects in real-time with diverse systems such as actual machines, XR, ROS, and the Web.


The following introduces the functions that can be realized by using the Hakoniwa-enabled version.

## Hakoniwa Drone Operation Python API

The Hakoniwa Drone Simulator supports drone operation and flight plan description through a Python API. This allows users to directly control the drone's behavior from Python scripts.

For example, the following operations are possible:

*   Drone takeoff
*   Drone movement
*   Debug display of drone position information
*   Cargo transport
*   Acquisition and file saving of front camera images
*   Acquisition and debug display of 3D LiDAR data
*   Drone landing

Furthermore, two types of this API are available depending on the application.

- 📘 Details: [Hakoniwa Drone Operation Python API](drone_api/README-ja.md)
  - An API based on the Hakoniwa system.
  - It allows direct control of the drone via PDU, enabling integration with Unity/Unreal visualization and external environment simulations.
  - Ideal for educational, training, and demonstration purposes.
- 📘 Details: [Python API (for Ardupilot / PX4)](docs/python_api/mavlink_api.en.md)
  - It utilizes `pymavlink` to link with Ardupilot and PX4 SITL.
  - It absorbs the control modes and state transitions of Ardupilot/PX4, allowing operation with a unified API.
  - It also supports multi-vehicle and mixed environments (Ardupilot + PX4).

## Simulation of External Environments (Wind, Temperature, etc.)

The Hakoniwa Drone Simulator provides a function to simulate external environments such as wind and temperature. This allows for the realistic reproduction of the effects of external factors on the drone's behavior.
For example, the following simulations are possible:

*   Drone flight affected by wind
*   Changes in drone performance due to temperature changes
*   Changes in drone flight characteristics due to atmospheric pressure changes
*   Effects of propeller wind due to boundaries (ceilings, floors, walls, etc.)

For details, please refer to [here](/docs/environment/README-ja.md).

A sample program for executing external environment simulations is provided in Python.
If you use this sample, please set up the [Hakoniwa Drone Operation Python API](#hakoniwa-drone-operation-python-api) in advance.

## Simulation with Multiple Vehicles

The Hakoniwa Drone Simulator provides the functionality to simulate multiple drone vehicles simultaneously.
This enables the simulation of more advanced scenarios, such as formation flight verification.

The multi-vehicle simulation supports the following flight controllers:

- Ardupilot
- PX4
- Control via Hakoniwa Drone Operation Python API

By specifying the number of instances in the configuration file, it is possible to simulate N vehicles simultaneously, not just two.

* The number of executable vehicles depends on the machine's performance.

### Multi-vehicle Architecture

The following diagram shows the configuration for a multi-vehicle simulation.

- In MAVLink-based control, an FCU (Ardupilot/PX4) instance is launched for each drone, and the Python client connects to each individually through MAVLink ports.
- In Hakoniwa PDU-based control, the Python client directly controls each drone instance via the PDU.
- Each vehicle has a corresponding `drone_config_x.json` that defines the aircraft and controller settings.

### Multi-vehicle Setup and Execution

- [Multi-vehicle simulation with Ardupilot](/docs/multi_drones/ardupilot.en.md)
- [Multi-vehicle simulation with PX4](/docs/multi_drones/px4.en.md)
- [Multi-vehicle control with Hakoniwa Drone Operation Python API](/docs/multi_drones/hakoniwa_python.en.md)

## Log Replay Feature

This simulator is equipped with a log replay feature that plays back recorded flight logs (`drone_dynamics.csv`).
This feature allows you to reproduce past simulation flights for detailed analysis and debugging.

Main features:
*   **Simulation Playback**: Faithfully reproduces the drone's movements based on log data.
*   **Playback Control**: Allows you to specify the playback range and change the playback speed (e.g., slow motion).
*   **Transparent Switching**: Since it uses the same interface as a normal simulation, you can check the replay using your existing visualization environment (Unity/Unreal) as is.

For detailed instructions on how to configure and run the replay feature, please refer to the following document:

*   [Log Replay Feature Details (replay/README.en.md)](replay/README.en.md)

## Comparison with Other OSS

The features of the Hakoniwa Drone Simulator, when compared with other OSS (Gazebo, AirSim, etc.), include the following points.
For detailed information, please see [Features of Hakoniwa Drone Simulator and Comparison with Other OSS](docs/evaluation/README.md).

### An "Open" Drone Simulator Designed for Integration:
The Hakoniwa Drone Simulator is not a closed simulator that is complete on its own, but is based on an open design philosophy that presupposes integration with digital twins and AI systems. Furthermore, it is lightweight, supports cross-platform, and can be deployed in various execution environments.

### Modular Design and "Engine Extraction" Supporting Flexibility:
Supporting this flexibility is the "microservice architecture" common to the entire Hakoniwa. The Hakoniwa Drone Simulator is also thoroughly modular in design, and a particularly noteworthy point is the realization of "extracting the engine part of the drone simulator," which is generally considered difficult. Since this engine part is independent as a library, it can be called directly from smartphones or XR devices. This allows for flexible adaptation to various sites such as education, research, and demonstrations.

### Strong Support System Unique to a Japanese Product:
On the other hand, existing OSS (Gazebo, AirSim, etc.) are mainly made overseas, and their introduction and customization require high technical knowledge, making the hurdle high especially for educational institutions and small and medium-sized organizations.
In that respect, the Hakoniwa Drone Simulator is developed in Japan, and by providing official support and educational services, it greatly lowers the hurdles for introduction and operation. Especially for educational and research institutions in Japan, the strong support system in Japanese is a major advantage.
